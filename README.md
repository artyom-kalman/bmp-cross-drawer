# BMP Cross Drawing

## Project Description

This is a simple C++ program that processes BMP (Bitmap) image files. The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Reads a BMP File**: The program reads an input BMP image file, ensuring compatibility with the BMP file format.
2. **Prints the Image to the Terminal**: The program converts the BMP image into an ASCII representation and prints it to the terminal for visualization.
3. **Draws a Cross**: The program draws a cross on the image, centered at the midpoint of the image. The cross consists of a horizontal and vertical line intersecting at the center.
4. **Saves the Resulting Image**: After drawing the cross, the program saves the modified image as a new BMP file.

This project demonstrates basic image manipulation using C++, including file I/O, pixel-level operations, and the use of the BMP file format. It is designed to be simple and educational, making it a great starting point for understanding image processing and file handling in C++.
